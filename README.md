**DSPy** is a declarative framework for building modular AI software. It allows you to iterate fast on structured code, rather than brittle strings, and offers algorithms that compile AI programs into effective prompts and weights for your language models, whether you're building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or Agent loops.
